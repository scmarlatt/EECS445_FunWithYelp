That said, I have so no such qualms about revealing their absolutely HORRENDOUS customer service practices.\n\nI spoke to a representative yesterday to sign up for internet service at my new apartment.  I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.  He quoted me 39.99 as their only current promotion for basic internet (not including moden/router rentals, upgraded speed, etc.) Taking him at his word, I accepted, and scheduled an installation.  Thus begins the tale of woe:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-  Later that night, on the internet:  I see advertised in giant, bold, colorful letters, $24.99 for basic internet.  Just about half the price of the \"promotion\" the representative offered me.\n\n-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price. TRANSFER 1, TO SALES!\n\n- Sales also confirms the much cheaper promotion, but says it is an online-only offer, and she absolutely cannot give it to me:  I can only receive it online, and I will need to reschedule my installation.  TRANSFER 2, TO THE INTERNET!\n\n- The internet promotion finds my address alright, but instead of being able to sign up online, every time I reach the promotion page for my address, I receive the same error message:  \"Your session has timed out or encountered an error. Please start over or click the \"Back Button\" on your browser. If you still wish to contact us.\"  This occurs over 3 different computers and the same number of unique browsers.  TRANSFER 3, TO THE ONLINE-CHAT REPRESENTATIVE!\n\n-  Online chat confirms again that the service is available, but I cannot achieve it online, only over the phone.  Having just been told the *exact opposite*, i attempt to point out the circular logic there, but to no avail. Apparently, reducing my price to their own advertised offer would be considered \"downgrading\" a customer, and he is not allowed to do that. TRANSFER 4, TO THE PHONE REPRESENTATIVE (AGAIN)!\n\n-  The new phone representative tells me that as I am NOT a customer, she cannot help me at all.  Still loving the contradictions (the last one claimed that she could not downgrade customers, now I'm not even a customer?  Really?), I try to argue, but she claims sales needs to handle me, and transfers my call.  TRANSFER 5, TO SALES (AGAIN)!\n\n- And at this point, after another few minutes of lovely Charter advertisements and soothingly torturous elevator music, I am transferred to... a voice mail.  This proceeds to Inform me that the Sales Depts. hours are over, so please call back later, and then terminates the call.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n3 fun filled hours of lies, contradictions, and a misinformation campaign that would dazzle ANY public figure later... absolutely nothing was accomplished, except a gigantic waste of my life and a review that will hopefully reveal these horrifying business practices to all those unsuspecting cable-seeking fellows on Yelp.\n\nBeware.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oLctHIA1AxmsgOuu4dM6Vw"}

Shortly after we first started with Charter our connection went out, took them days to send someone out and it turned out they'd disconnected us for no reason at all. Thanks Charter. Fast forward to the recent past when our bill went up, I called up to try and get a new promotional rate because I'm no paying $60 for internet that bombs out briefly a couple times a day. They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. \nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website?\nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again. After calling to disconnect I got several calls from Charter trying to get my business back if perhaps they offered me a really good rate but by that point they'd managed to blow whatever shred of credibility they had left in my mind.

There are plenty of other HVAC companies who are more competent and communicative.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZW2WeP2Hp20tq0RG1NFkoQ"}

What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\n\nMy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\n\nThe negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \n\nIf it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

However, the morning after Thanksgiving, it was obviously time to consume more food, so off to the Green Lantern we went.

Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.\n\nService was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.

There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \n\nDriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.\n\nBecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \n\nI ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. \n\nAll in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

At that point we were offered the \"quick alternative\" of a table downstairs.

Those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids.  Maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host.\n\nOur server was very attentive and the food was good.  We tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish.

I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rdAdANPNOcvUtoFgcaY9KA"}

I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  And don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA"}

She said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food.

Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  \n\nThe bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \n\nFor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \n\nCraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  \n\nMy fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.

So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.\n\nThe highlights:\n- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. \n- Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.\n- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. \n- The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. \n\nIf you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XrzTVrJAjs0yYLvhFI9vkQ"}

Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.

I'm sure the Great Barrier Reef is worth a 5 star review, but I can't give it only 3 stars because its inconvenient (or any review for that matter). \n\nAnyway...saw Crandalls in Madison Magazine and the photos stood out to me. I didn't want to drive to the East Side for the Esquire Club. I was reluctant to try take out fish fry because I was worried about fried food getting soggy. \n\nI gave it a shot and I was impressed! \n\nFirst, the fish to beading ratio was really good. Big thick pieces of flaky fish with a dense, probably corn meal based, and crumb-style breaking (as opposed to the extra greasy tempura- style batter). It was nice and crunchy and the breading stayed that way on my 5-10 minute drive home. Tip: crack the styrofoam container to let the steam out for extra insurance against soggy fish. Served with a lemon. \n\nThe fries were coated in something that made them extra crispy and they had a good seasoning. \n\nThe slaw had good flavor but lots of dressing. Purists might say it was over dressed; others might say its just right. \n\nTarter sauce was a little sweet and tangy, which was good contrast with the fish. The server gladly gave me extra. \n\nThe bun was just as you would expect from a supper club, cheap, white, and doughy. Served with a butter chip. \n\nEverything was served together in a box; everything you need except several icy cold beers.\n\nThe service was fine. The take out window was nice. It takes a few minutes for the order but I think they fry-to-order which is well worth it to me and a big plus. Any you cut it, it takes less time than waiting in line for dine in Friday Fish Fry.\n\nA little spendy for take out fish fry ringing up at over $25 for two dinners. That would be more than fair if I could park my fat ass there all night and eat all-you-can-eat. \n\nIt's worth it though and I'll be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HxPpZSY6Q1eARuiahhra6A"}

The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.

He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.

It only comes in a serving that serves 2-3. Which is a great value because the 3 of us easily got 2 cups each out of it.\n\nThe Fragrant Pork had chestnuts, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a garlic tomato sauce, Said that it was spicy hot put I only got a tiny bit of kick.

But I couldn't stop tasting the sauce. It was like no other white sauce I have tasted before. The waitress poured the sauce for the dish right in front of you so it was \"sizzling\". The rice was on the bottom of the skillet plate so it ended up getting crunchy. Adding a great texture to the dish. The shrimp, scallops and chicken in the dish were tender.

This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\n\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\n\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.\n\nLast time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.

Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully. The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy.

In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda. And the color is a light peach color. If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here.

We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not. His level of customer service was appalling.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9brW55Vzyi3ItboHWfoepg"}

The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.

Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.

Earlier this year, I had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  A family member was in the hospital at UW-Madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\n\nI'm not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  The other reason not to get so detailed is simply because I think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \n\nAs I mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  This allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  Most of the staff knew me by name.  They were sensitive to the fact that I had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. I wasn't alone in this, though.  There were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  This hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  In addition, I would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \n\nThe manager, Brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  He and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  The social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. And, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \n\nThere are several hotel options recommended by UW and we tried three of them.  This one may be five miles away from the main UW hospital, but it is a straight shot along University Avenue.  Now that UW purchased the Best Western Intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to UW patients.  The Intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. The Staybridge-Middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not remember all the names of the staff that I would love to thank.  Our housekeeper was perfect.  She cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  For instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of Kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  She always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \n\nI noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  It's obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  For instance, I first met Bonnie on the shuttle.  She arrived at UW Hospital to pick me up.  She even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  During my stay, I also saw Bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  It turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\n\nI also feel like I got to know Ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  Between her and Bonnie, I just don't know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \n\nThere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, I can't seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  She was so welcoming and learned what I like to eat and drink.  She even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when I needed to rush back to the hospital.  It was like being with family.\n\nJan, Justin and Bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  Not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \n\nMy final comments are definitely not the least important.  During my stay, I noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  I was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. There may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  However, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  I commend Brad Cook for making diversity a priority.\n\nUntil my next stay...", "type": "review", "business_id": "rKNtd_M2kWDW8sQKYzetKA"}

I really liked the scones, but I didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  I didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time I had stopped the place seemed empty.  This was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 AM and I was the first person through the door.  So this weekend, based on Chris & Kelly's recommendations, I stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  I found out that all this time I was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\n\nI was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  The place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  I walked up and ordered the breakfast special - I was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  The price was OK, not under $6 but not more than I would have expected anywhere else.  I was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  I'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and I was really impressed by the decor.  I got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - I love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but I tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  The coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  I savored it while I read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\n\nAfter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  The wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but I was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  It was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  The special, which was basically a Denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  The wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  I was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  I wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the Prairie Cafe.

It's largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  You place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  When you're done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\n\nThe pancakes aren't anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  They're cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  They're not obscenely thick; in fact, they're a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\n\nBreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\n\nI've also had the Wright Breakfast and today, I had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  Again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\n\nThey're currently serving Alterra-brand coffee; another review references Ancora, but it looks like they've switched to Alterra.  It's good coffee, nonetheless.\n\nStaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  They don't take credit/debit cards - it's cash or check only.  There's a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  There tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren't your thing, steer clear on Saturday and Sunday.

My breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.

My husband and I spent the weekend in Middleton and came here twice because it was so good! \n\nReally enjoyed the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out to the table. The fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. I was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. Kind of makes us want to move out here!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

The food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn't great, but the atmosphere is nice and I didn't come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. The staff also isn't particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \n\nToday is Sunday, and I arrived around 8am. I usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so I'm not taking up a table. I bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. Just over an hour later, I was approached by a middle-aged man whom I assume is the owner or manager but whom I've never seen before. He asked if I was aware of their \"new policy\" about Wi-Fi on Sunday mornings, and how they don't want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said.) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel.\" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way.\n\nI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors. If the food was exceptional I might try to swallow my pride, but it's really nothing special. There are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a Starbucks across the road) and I will be patronizing them instead from now on.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \n\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \n\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.\n\nThings I like:\n * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\n\nThings I don't\n *The \"cash only\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\n\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ShEYKerTwb2LSORE5o_s7A"}

My first indication that I was not in Peking, was the Hispanic girl struggling to understand my English ordering and the POS system which was also in English.

The fried rice was disgusting, just a greasy mush of dirty looking rice, mushrooms and egg. Finally, the pot stickers, ah the pot stickers, they should have stuck to the pot.

I've never dined in, so I won't comment on atmosphere.\n\nTheir menu and nutritional info is easily accessed on line. \n\nFor the most part, I've had OK experiences with the food selections. I don't expect spectacular food from this place, it is, after all, 'Fast Food' from a restaurant chain. It's nothing really special. \n\nHowever, today I had an experience that sort of turned my stomach a bit. I ordered a Shrimp and Veggie Stir fry to go. When I got back to work and went to dig in, I was a little disgusted to find that the shrimp were not deveined prior to cooking. For those of you who don't know what that means: The Shrimp's digestive track (seen as a dark brown 'vein' along the spine of the shrimp) wasn't removed, which means that the digestive track and it's contents were left in place. Yes, I know it's not horrible to eat it, but if you know what it is, it can turn your stomach. I assumed that a restaurant such as this would devein shrimp prior to cooking. \n\nI pulled all the shrimp and deveined them myself, but I'd already lost my appetite. I did put the shrimp aside and ate some of the brown rice and veggies, but with my stomach already feeling a bit nauseous, that didn't go well. So now I'm left with an $8 meal sitting on my desk (soon to hit the garbage) with only about 1/8th of it consumed and having to find an alternative for lunch. \n\nLesson learned, if I'm craving a good stir fry with shrimp, shell out the extra cash for PF Changs.\n\n**** I thought eventually I'd go back, but I haven't been since then.

I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \n\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \n\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \n\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \n\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's. It's on the way home from work, the food comes out fast and I can't resist those damn cream cheese wontons. Maybe I'll throw in some potstickers or wraps and call it dinner.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KW6HejC-67KSL9J8Cz1dSw"}

For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\n\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \n \n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\n\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \"Like It\", \"Love It\" and \"Gotta Have It\" serving size names.\n\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"Ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\n\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "AYoLKzRFajucKnjIFxc__A"}

At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \n\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\n\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.", "type": "review", "business_id": "c5awCF5eu0ZkxUf_i94uPA"}

I wish I could give them ten stars! I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot. Anyone who likes The Walking Dead AND Downton Abbey is alright in my book!\n\nAll Pets has been able to see me with very short notice, has never rushed me in and out the door, and always made me feel like my dogs were their top priority, even on busier days. They communicate clearly about diagnostic and treatment options. Their prices are very reasonable, and they try less expensive solutions first, instead of immediately recommending the most costly. Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up. When they weren't 100% positive about something, they aren't afraid to ask each other for second opinions, which I appreciated when my dog Harry swallowed a corncob and had to have emergency surgery.\n\nThat's another thing I love about this place, is that they remember all my dogs names when I walk in the door. Not only the vets, but the front desk staff. Maybe it's my fiction-writer's imagination, but they really make me feel like a VIP. Kenna is always so excited to greet my pups and I love hearing about hers. Dana has a killer sense of humor and if you're lucky, she'll grace you with one of her zingers. Having three rambunctious corgis that get into trouble (catching rabbits and getting worms, swallowing corncobs and needing surgery, attacking car windows and breaking teeth, spraining toes from too much running) means I get to visit more often, and I honestly do not mind at all.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9874O-3GjXPotxYKNNAz5Q"}

Check-in was simple and the employees seemed to enjoy our enthusiasm and joking around. They even welcomed us with fresh cookies. How can you hate on a hotel with cookies?

The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\n\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\n\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life.

Thursday nights feature Westside Andy & Mel Ford, and that is always a good time.  There are decent taps, though last time I was there I believe they had removed Esser's Best which was my go-to every time there.  Most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but I especially like that Capital pints are $2 on Wednesdays and you can get pitchers of Spotted on Fridays for a crazy $5.  I also learned that your second drink before noon on Sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents.  More on that later.  The bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars.\n\nThe food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good.  Sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu.  Once I ordered a Reuben that strangely was lacking Swiss cheese, though I didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich.  I like the bison burger here, but the last time I ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time.  Also that day my sister found the Hody Chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness.  My sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the Hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special Hody sauce.  It might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times I've been here there were no problems.  I do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in.  Some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job.  I haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately.  I've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time I've had them.  \n\nThe main drawback with the Hody is the regular crowd.  On Thursdays when Westside Andy & Mel Ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables.  Other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking.  It can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in.  Sundays can be the worst.  I think that some of those people nearly live there.  The place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky.  There is a few outdoor tables along Elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon.  I would probably return to the Hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that I sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the Hody is a reliably good time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xbJ9tdGbcVJIUkNgHSCwZQ"}

I also had roasted shrimp for my entree, which were delicious! Nice spicy flavor, with a ton of rosemary. I wasn't too impressed with the side of spinach and tomatoes, however. The Cabernet reduction that they came DOUSED in was a bit too rich. I wish it had been more of a glaze than a heavy sauce. No matter, I was too full to eat much of it anyhow. My boyfriend seemed surprised and delighted by the coffee roasted chicken with the orange-ricotta sauce( the bite I had was quite tasty). \n\nAlso, I love the fact that they have live jazz on the piano tues-sat nights starting at 6pm(although tonight he started more like 6:30).

It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New Orleans mood.\n\nThe food is incredible. Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get.

We've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.\n\nThe only con I can give Louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts.

The decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  There was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  Only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from Capital. \nEventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  Found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\nApp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  Seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (I think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  Two thumbs way up.\nApp #2: mussels in cream sauce... I had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  They were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  But the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  And the bread they serve is quite good.  Two thumbs up.\nEntree: Crawfish Etouffe... I was excited to try this as I hadn't had etouffe in years.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  If you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale Cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  Two thumbs halfway up.  The salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\nMidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  For dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  It seemed to be thickened with gelatin and I suppose I prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  Again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be REALLY good.\nOur server was very nice & professional.  Absolutely no complaints there.\nThe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\nWe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  \n\nService is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told \"yeah, if you can find seats\".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. \n\nIt's a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island.

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \n\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \n\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \n\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \n\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \n\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \n\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \n\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  Madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to Lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

Having never been to Louisianne's in the 5 years that I've lived in Middleton, I suggested we try it out.\n\nI give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. Although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. You walk into Louisianne's and immediately head downstairs. It's all stone and looks like you're walking into a cool cave or something. It's dark, but there's a lot of ambiance. I've been to New Orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. It's romantic, fun, and not what you'd expect from the outside. I felt like we were on vacation while we were there. Also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. It was awesome!\n\nWe went at about 8pm on a Friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. While we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. I had red wine, and my husband had Jameson on the rocks. \n\nWe were seated and ordered the Pecan Crab Cakes as an appetizer. They were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other Midwestern crab cakes that I've had before. They were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of Old Bay seasoning. Again, they weren't bad at all, but not spectacular.\n\nNext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  We were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. They had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which I got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). Both soups were fantastic! Definitely 5 stars for the soup. \n\nI'll take a minute here to comment that I enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (It reminds me of dining in Wisconsin supper clubs as a child). By the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \n\nOnto the entrees! My husband absolutely LOVED his dish. He claims that it was possibly \"the best thing I've ever had in a restaurant\". He chose the Coffee Roasted Chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". I think there was spinach in it too. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. It almost reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. Although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. It had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. Delicious. 5 stars.\n\nThe reason that Louisianne's is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which I felt was very underwhelming. We don't eat pasta at home for health reasons, so I usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. I chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic New Orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). The shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. The dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. However, the pasta was supposed to have a \"Creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn't really. The sauce was very light, and had little flavor. It was kind of sad, because I was really hoping to be wowed and I wasn't. I'd say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \n\nThe service was adequate. Nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\n\nSummary: I'd definitely return. I think Lousianne's Etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. Their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on Yelp, seems to be consistency. Some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. The major problem with this is that Louisianne's  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won't return for a second chance. I think this explains why the Yelp reviews for Louisianne's are so polarized.", "type": "review", "business_id": "koRLvzIl-4fCybOIdk56jA"}

I thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since I totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \n\nExcept, the place was fully booked for the \"Little Miss Junior Miss\" Pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant HELL for Andy and I as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  Can you say O. M. G.  \n\nNow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  But this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. This made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \n\nI realize this is hardly Marriotts fault that the Junior Misses had descended upon Middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  Nice.  And also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  Nice planning!\n\nMan, that whole experience left a bad taste.  The worst part will be trying to convince Andy to stay at a Marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on Saturday.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

It's disturbing that Parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like Cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. \nThe hotel was totally booked. You had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. It was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. \nAnd the kicker was on Sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. Of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. That was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the Marriott-Madison West.

It would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\n- The 20min it took to get extra towels\n- The empty ice bin in the vending area\n- The desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\n\nBy far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at EIGHT IN THE MORNING.

Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  It greatly lacks attention to detail.  I frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.

I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  All of the power in the room was then knocked out.  This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  I was lucky my computer was not fried.  The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  I then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.  Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.

Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well.

I knew this cause the phone was tan/beige colored.  It was yucky.  Also, the tub liner in the first room was filthy.  Another thing I wish this hotel would change is installing fans in the bathrooms!  My boyfriend also pointed out that the sheets on the bed were super starched.   If you moved it sounded like sandpaper on sandpaper.  Madness.  I did have a odd triangle shaped hole in the sheets on my side of the bed...so that was less than plesant too.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\n\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\n\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\n\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\n\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\n\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\n\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\n\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\n\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  If you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some Marriott properties.\n\nThis Marriott has its own free parking lot.  It is easy finding an open space.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

There is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \n\nThis Marriott is about the level of a nicer Courtyard Marriott. The ONLY way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. If we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. A cocktail reception on a Tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   However a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a BULLHORN at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. We had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \n\nAdditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. Every other Marriott (including most Courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. At this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. Not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. Plus the coffee is not high quality. The attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\n\nI also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. Prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. It was a little frustrating.  As for the ACTUAL service, it was hit or miss. One day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. Another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom, zero toiletries replenished, and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. A call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  Also, the in-room fridge does not fully work, and our hummus, juices, and other snacks were spoiled. \n\nI get that this is the area's biggest conference center, so maintaining business is not a problem for them. However, for those of us who travel frequently and experience many Marriott properties, this one does not come up to scratch, but again, the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

Nothing outstanding, but it is nice to have a window to look at something besides a brick wall.  You get a parking lot view but you get motion.  \n\nThe banquet rooms were gorgeous.

Not a huge hill, but enough to make the walk precarious during these icy times.  Perhaps a little more salt could be expended for visitors.  The location is nice as it is near restaurant and a mall.

It is about 1/4 mile off the beltline and just outside of Madison (by one highway exit).  \n\nIf you want to stay in Madison but avoid the high prices of downtown and the congestion of rush hour, this is the place to be.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\n\nThe majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\n\nWe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  The other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  There is one conference room (the Monona Room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  On the day before the event, you guessed it; the Marriott staff moved us to that room.  The calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the Monona Room.\n\nLike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\n\nThings I liked:\n* I enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\n\n* Other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\n\n* While the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\n\nThings I didn't:\n* The rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  With its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\n\n* If you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\n\n* My least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  For $14.95, I expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  What I received was very different.  Served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  The institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  The server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  The roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\n\nOverall, the experience with the Marriott Madison West was A-OK, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ckLRf3lYn9DxmNxd-mu2yA"}

I've stayed in Madison plenty of times for work, and overall, this is the nicest hotel that I've stayed at.  Pros: staff are very nice and friendly.  Hotel has gym, pool, and business center at no additional cost.  You know how some hotels have that teeny tiny kiosk to print your boarding pass, and that's all you can do?  There are 2 computers hooked up to printers so can you do real tasks like check your email, Yelp, etc.  The beds are VERY comfortable.  It shocked me how nice they were.  Bathrooms have stone countertops and something heating the mirror, so that after a shower your mirror is still usable, not all fogged up.  Someone had their thinking hat on.  The hotel is walkable to several restaurants & I think they provide room service, but they will also help you order from a nearby restaurant if you arrive late in the evening.\n\nFor a hotel this size, they do a really good job with breakfast.  It's a buffet with the usual cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and hot food.  But they really go an extra mile on the eggs, and every egg dish is cooked to order.  Whether you want 1 scrambled egg or full omelette, they'll make it for you fresh, give you a table tent number, and then bring it to you.\n\nI have 2 more trips this year to Madison, and hope I'm staying here again!", "type": "review", "business_id": "MBQc_jlZ3nlMOZy7SUM_5Q"}

Firstly, breakfast stops at 11:00 on weekdays and noon on the weekends, NOTE THAT because when we showed up today after my husbands late night shift the night before they would not serve us breakfast.\n\nCASH OR CHECK ONLY\n\nWorth noting, both menus are pretty slim, but breakfast is larger than lunch.  \n\nThey were out of the fried chicken \"dinner\" (you mean lunch, since they were only open till 2, right?). We ended up ordering the patty melt, ok, fish sandwich, subpar, and onion rings, good but not $3 good. Sandwiches come with chips, not fries.  But was definitely not the pancakes that everyone else was raving about that I was craving.  The coffee was sting but a bit bitter. The total was just under $20 without tip. \n\nThe decor is old, doesn't bother me too much, but looking at the filthy carpets, it was disgusting and I was a bit afraid since I was wearing flat sandals.  Before I forget to mention it, the place smells like smoke when you first walk in, I was completely expecting to see ashtrays at the booths.\n\nThe service was excellent... If you are a regular. If not, plan on spending about three times too much there. We waited for about 5 minutes for our waitress ( one of the owners) to shout sit where you want.  We grabbed a table. My husband had to take a work call, but had given me his order. After waiting 10 minutes, I had to flag our waitress down to place our orders, and she looked at me shocked that I would want something to eat. Trying to get the check out of her was terrible. By 12:15 the lunch regulars had started coming in, so she was chatting about a recent wedding, showings hem the wedding pictures, talking about what the place looked like, etc. by 12:30 I had out cash on the end of the table hoping to move things along.  She walked past us three times without making eye contact, finally, I put my arm out and asked for the check, which had not been prepared, wait for another 5 minutes while she served more regulars and FINALLY she got back to using we were out of there by 12:50. \n\nIn short, we will never return.  It is expensive for what you get, food is unremarkable, serve is terrible, and it seemed like it could use a food service inspection because it was pretty dirty.", "type": "review", "business_id": "X47o6R2rWiqGqvBtC7VS3Q"}

True, Dick isn't around much - but in his defense, he's probably been cutting hair for 50+ years, so he deserves some time away.\n\nThat said, I've gone back twice since my last review (my hair grows fast), and every cut has been absolutely stellar.  Ka, who has cut my hair the last two times, is absolutely wonderful.  Very attentive, very helpful, extremely friendly, and really knows how to cut hair.  \n\nThe place seems to thrive on walk-ins, so don't bother making an appointment.  I think that trying to schedule an appointment is the only downside to Dick & Arnie's... and, it was my only source of frustration.  As soon as I accepted the fact that it's best to just walk-in, life has been great.\n\nSet aside 30-40 minutes and walk-in.  Your haircut will take 15-20 minutes, tops; the extra time is \"cushion\" just in case the place is full.  Don't worry about who does your hair - everyone there seems to know exactly what they're doing, and they do it well.\n\n$15 for a stellar haircut?  No brainer.

Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\n\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\n\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\n\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\n\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \n\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \"average.\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\n\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\n\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\n\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\nValue = 4 stars \nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\n\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.

I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

Some co-workers had been raving about them, and ever the skeptic, I had to verify the claims for myself.\n\nArrived at around noon on a Friday, and copped-a-squat at one of the numerous bar stools.  A very friendly bartender walked over, menu in hand, and asked what I'd like to drink.  I ordered an iced tea, and browsed the menu.\n\nTea arrived within a minute, and I placed my order: cheese curds and a bacon cheeseburger, with pepper jack, cooked medium, please.\n\nThe bartender left with my order, and I passed the time by watching the Big-10 basketball tournament and gazing around at the large and expansive bar area.\n\nThe food arrived, and it looked spectacular.  Let's start with the curds.\n\nFriends, I know curds.  Believe me.  You can read all you want about the \"awwwesome\" and \"amaaaaaazing\" curds from the Old Fashioned - those suck.  Point blank - they suck.  They're greasy, they're usually over-cooked, and they're bland.\n\nWhat \"saves\" the OF's curds is their tiger sauce.  And I don't care who you are, but to borrow from another reviewer, \"Sauce does not a good curd make\" (sorry Doctress, I saw your line in the El Tigre review, and had to borrow it).  \n\nThe Sport Bowl's curds are DEFINITELY homemade.  You can tell simply by looking at them that these offerings begin as simple, unbreaded curds, are battered and rolled in a breading (probably Cornflake or cracker?), and then carefully deep-fried.\n\nAnd the result speaks for itself.  They are EXCELLENT.  So good (see photo).  The bartender confirmed they take 'bare' curds, and give 'em the batter/breading treatment, all to order.  I believe him.  You need to believe me - these are the best curds you'll find outside of Green County.\n\nThe burger was equally excellent, and I'm going to go on record to say the burgers here are without a doubt in the Top 3 for Madison-area burgers.  \n\nKnoche's Market supplies the beef.  It's hand-pattied and grilled to perfection.  I asked for medium and received a true medium burger.  The burger wasn't dry and it wasn't greasy.  It had a delicious smokey, charcoaled flavor that instantly brought back memories of mid-summer grill-nights back home...\n\nThe pepperjack had a nice kick, and the bacon served as pork-icing on the cow cake (I'd have said 'beef cake' but that's a bit over-the-top).\n\nThe bun was light and airy - very fresh tasting and lightly toasted.  \n\nThe burger was so good that I'd have no problem eating it completely plain - burger and bun alone.  That's saying something.\n\nMiddleton SportBowl = WIN\n\nFood = 4.75 stars\nValue = 4.5 stars\nService = 4 stars\nMISC = 3.5 stars (not super inviting environment, but it's a bar/bowling alley)\n\nSummary:\n- Best curds in Madison\n- Top 3 burger in Madison-area\n- Go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.\n\nThis review is all about the food.  Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \n\nWhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent.  Not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \n\nA quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  The pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  The \"Philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\n\nThe best part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  But it will probably cost more than your entire meal here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lN-5-YTsaJr_IByyA476iw"}

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\n\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\n\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\n\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\n\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\n\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \n\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \n\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\n\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \n\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \n\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\n\nStamm House = FAIL\n\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\nService: 4.5 stars \nValue: 3 stars\n\n\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IEmqrFe96NOhU07TA0rZdw"}

The best part is that if you get there at any time other than lunchtime, you get fresh fries.\n\nThe only thing I don't like is how they put mayo on some of their burgers, but they never have a problem with making one without mayo.  Service is always friendly, but sometimes a little slow.  Oh yeah, you should also stay away from the chicken strips.  They're bad.\n\nThe decor here is awesome, with wood paneling straight out of the 80's and cheap plastic booths.  There's even a sterile-looking wall clock on one of the walls.

The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\n\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.\n\nSo, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the \"local\" places, and the Village Green is definitely a \"local\" place.

My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.

All new equipment and works great. \n\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \n\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \n\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\n\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\n\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot.

Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\n\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\n\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\n\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g"}

I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.     Not A New Client!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mbtGl2I2A2To-8jiggN99g"}

I received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what I spent on the Living Social coupon I am satisfied with the results, but if I had paid full price for these services I would be very dissatisfied.  \n\nThere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at Tangles.  The salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  I didn't get that \"Aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"Cost Cutters vibe\" (nothing against CC, but if I'm paying $75 for highlights I'd like the atmosphere to match the price).

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).\n\n There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \n\nWe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous.

There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.  Yes, it is probably my loss, but I don't enjoy being insulted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

They need to drag folks in, so they make you play, come hell or high water.  I've heard rumors of sand volleyball...in the snow.  Maybe I'm just bitter. cold.\n\nThe food is nothing worth writing home about.  The sandwiches are pretty standard fare and nachos are decent.  I'm a sucker for seasoned fries and they're pretty decent here, so I'll add another star.  Unfortunately, the beer isn't cheap, nor were there other obvious specials.  Look around and find somewhere else if you're out for an evening of drinking.\n\nThe TVs aren't all that great for a sports bar, which the Club Tavern tries to achieve, as far as I can tell.  There is a projector and large screen, but I haven't seen it used.They've got a couple of pool tables and dartboards as well.\n\nThe bartenders aren't terrible, it just takes some time for them to warm up to you.

None of us had ever been there.\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I've had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you've had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\n\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\n\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\n\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\n\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\n\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\n\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\n\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\n\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\n\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\n\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\n\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\n\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don't get messed up by much.\n\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.  Also noted her old fashioned came w cherries and olives in it, which is taboo? Supposed to be one or other?

Quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  Nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  A bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\n\nDetailed review:\nI've lived near C's for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  Folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"Meh.\"  I run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, so I figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, I treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\n\nI wandered in at around 9:30am on Memorial Day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  The hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so I happily took the offer.  I also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\n\nA waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - I went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  She came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  She left to tend to another table; I needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and I was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\n\nBreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\n\nThe waitress stopped by to ask if I was ready to order - told her I decided on the \"Hen's Nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  I also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  She apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  We were in business.  \n\nBefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if I'd like anything in the hashbrowns.  I was pleased!  C's has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but I didn't want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, I jumped at the chance.\n\nFood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  The pancake was a lot thinner than I had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  I found myself wishing I had ordered 2.  \n\nThe Hen's Nest was just \"OK\" - the hashbrowns weren't greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn't do much for flavor, oddly enough... I found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \n\nThe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  The waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the Hen's Nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\n\nService = 2 stars (nothing great)\nFood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\nValue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\nMISC = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\n\nI'd really like to give C's 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling a bit generous so, it's a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  Had I been in a crankier mood, it would've gone 2-stars... :-)\n\nFor what it's worth, I think the Hubbard Avenue Diner has a better overall breakfast, and it's about 1/2 the price.  It'll probably be a while before I visit C's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "B0Vuwn6Hugc-0U5n31YBfg"}

(This made me happy, as I like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) The skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. The eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. I do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. In fact, the onions were damn near raw. Luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but I take away a star for that .\n\n(BF says his potatoes were underdone too. Not raw, but not quite done enough.)\n\nWaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. And, since it was a bakery, we HAD to at least try a cinnamon roll.  It was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \n\nI noticed that they had a LOT of baked goods specializing with Strawberry and Rhubarb, which is in season right now. To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \n\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too.

Not a bad deal; they just need to make the beers at the bar cheaper so you can leave with a smile on your face.\n\nI believe they do tours on the weekends at 1:30 and 3:30, and they do offer then during weekdays.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg"}

I've never done the tour or hung out in the Bier Stube, though they're both on my list, but between Memorial Day and Halloween I try to make my way over to Terrace Avenue as often as possible.  It's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to Bockfest in February as well as wait in line for Great Taste tickets in May.  These are good times in their own regard, but the best times I've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  On weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  And while it's pretty easy to find Capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  As an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  This past summer my go-to was the Wild Rice Lager, as well as the Supper Club lager on the really hot nights.  There's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including Wollersheim's Prairie Fume.  \n\nI've got a decent history going on with the Bier Garten, as this was one of the places I went on my 21st birthday.  My buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  I've still got it to this day, and I bring it with every time I go out.  Suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  If you're planning on coming back I definitely recommend making the investment.  It beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and I'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\n\nThere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  My personal go-to is Gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and I believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  I've even ordered Falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  Capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  Mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is Wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  The place closes down at 9:00 PM in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  On weekends it's a great start to the evening, and I really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Wn8NhS-L1ck6jbTjX88Kkg"}

The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table.

Crikey - I'm losing it, I tell 'ya.\n\nNo visit to the Madison area would be complete without stopping-by the Capital Brewery.  During the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  It's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \n\nPicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  Bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  Or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  Dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \n\nA large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most Friday and Saturday nights.  They used to show movies on Saturday nights, but I believe that has come to pass.\n\nThe staff is always excellent.  You won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  Kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  He often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\n\nDuring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  There's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  The stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\n\nThe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  Prices are more than reasonable.  The bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\n\nSo... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  Stop by on a Saturday or Sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of Capital's great beers.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\"PD\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).", "type": "review", "business_id": "uyp8kpTXKfKXvAB8HdJSAA"}

For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.\n\nWe arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.\n\nWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.\n\nIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

When the Gyro arrived, it reeked of rotten deer carcass, the plate was filthy and the fries were colder than Alaska in December.  I'm not joking.  The Gyro tasted so bad that I had to spit a mouthful of it into a napkin and slug down a glass of water to cleanse the horse-s--t taste from my mouth.  \n\nSarah noticed that I hadn't eaten my food, she offered to remove it from the bill with out me asking.  I would normally applaude that gesture, but some older foreign lady (I assume the owner) came over and told her not to do that.  \"I'll make you new sandwich,\" said the old lady. I declined.

I paid my 9 dollars for a lousy cup of liquid Velveeta and left.\n\nI bet the Dairy Queen across the parking lot is glad that Sir Hobo's is back open.

Sadness. Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin.\n\n\nI resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed.\n\nTheir selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however, in terms of quality and freshness, it's rather good. Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):\n\n- peanut butter chicken\n- mongolian beef\n- chow mein\n- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)\n- crab rangoons (better than average)\n- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)\n- popcorn shrimp\n- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)\n- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)\n- seafood stir fry w/ veggies\n- fish fillets\n- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.\n\nI like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course, afterwards, I had to nap off the food coma ...", "type": "review", "business_id": "5uxhIGZlJm9g_zfG_83z5Q"}

We love the indoor family and warm water pools. The nursery staff is excellent. I like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  I love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \nOne advice I would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. We have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. The water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. This past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. So, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with GC membership. \nThe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00PM. Sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. If that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. So, I would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. They have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there.

Lots and lots of cardio equipment + 4 different weight areas\n3. Indoor soccer field, track, basketball courts, and racquetball courts\n4. Lots of classes - aerobics, swimming, spinning, etc\n5. Outdoor pools with waterpark\n6. Childcare\n\nCons\n1. Expensive membership with required 2 year contract\n2. You only have access to all the things listed above under the Pros section if you have the Gold Cove membership, which is the most expensive package.  Regardless of having the most expensive membership, you still have to pay extra for most of the classes.  \n3. If you have anything less than the Gold Cove membership, there is one older woman at the front desk, as you check in, who will look at you like you're trying to steal the tanning bed she lives in.  However, there is also a younger one with long, dark hair, who is more of an equal opportunity offender.  She'll treat you like crap, no matter what your status.\n4. If you don't have Gold Cove forget about going to the waterpark, unless you want to pay 23 dollars per person to get in.  \n5. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT bring in any of your own food.  If they catch you anywhere in the facility with so much as a pretzel stick, they will go off on you, thusly informing you that you can only consume food and beverages purchased at THEIR lounge/bar/crappy food place.  Because you know, you might be trying to smuggle in crack cocaine with your pretzels. \n6. Lounge/bar area serves you the crappiest, overpriced food you can find.  I don't know about the bar because I didn't go to a health club to drink.  \n7. Parking is a nightmare, especially in the mornings, and right around the time people are coming home from work.  While that is to be expected, the countless number of SUVs and big pick ups with something to prove, stalking people as they head to their vehicles makes for a dangerously crowded, and highly annoying situation.\n\nThere you have it.

So allow me to begin again.\n\nThis Walmart location is one of the teeny tiny, original designs.  The parking lot has so many huge dips and holes I sometimes think I am being forced to go spelunking in my car.  \n\nThe old lady greeters at the front door are my favorite part of the experience because they remind me of grandma.  But they would probably mace me if I tried to run up and give them a hug.  \n\nThey have a fabric department, which seems to be a feature that the newer, super walmarts are missing.  Unfortunately, the store is usually running a skeleton crew most of the time, so it's hard to find an employee in that section of the store who knows how to cut some fabric.  \n\nMost of the employees here are like most of the employees at any Walmart, underpaid, and overworked.  So it doesn't bother me too much when they frown at me.  I've been on the other side of the register before, so I know how soul crushing it can be.  Though, they may not be frowning at me because of that reason, they probably just know I'm an incredible dufus.  \n\nHowever, there is one employee there who is usually cashiering, and has this wonderful Russian accent.  She's also very friendly and cheery.  The other day she was telling me about growing her own basil, freezing it in ice cube trays with chicken stock, and then plopping the cubes in rice later on for flavoring.  Tricky, tricky!  \n\nAnyway, I guess I am more impressed by the larger Walmart in Monona that has the shopping cart escalators.  I could stand there all day and launch carts down that thing, it really revs up the dork in me.  \n\nBut in the meantime, if I don't feel like heading over that way I could just stop at this Walmart to get maced by the grannies and listen to cooking recipes from Nina.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tZbKiggbDGeBpGnOYk0Syw"}

The employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful. The cashiers are mostly the former. Having done that exact job, I can relate.  \n\nThey have a couple of small aisles with food stuffs (bread, cereal) and there are coolers in the front with milk and OJ, which is wonderful when all you need is some cheap fabric, a gallon of milk, and a tube of mascara. \n\nThere are plans to build a new Wal-Mart right behind this one, then demolish this one and turn it into parking lot.

No big deal, right? Except that both cars sat and waited for a few minutes. I thought the first car was disabled because it sat there so long. \n\nThe store itself is fine. It's a Super Walmart, so it has the grocery store side. It's a lot like the one in Monona, but without the fun underground parking (best thing I've ever seen in a Walmart) and escalator. I tried to check out using the self-checkout because it is faster when I only have ten items or so. Well, this self-checkout machine was troublesome. It kept telling me I had unauthorized items in bagging area (uh, it was the item I'd just slid over the laser) and then it said I had a restricted item and needed cashier approval to finish up and pay. I didn't have any alcohol, bullets, weapons, or cigarettes. I had a 2-pack of lighters, which was probably it, but why? At any rate, the guy monitoring the self-checkout had to come over and help me three different times. This was in no way faster than just going through a regular register. \n\nThe cashier who helped me to checkout and a guy I asked about Nutella were both nice, but it was an overall frustrating experience.

All the other employees are stretched as thin as possible to cover the rest of the store.  I'm in sporting goods, I need a fishing license.  Nope.

We read and reviewed the contract, gave her a non-refundable deposit check and we were in the booking book!\n\nMy daughter Dylilah and I reviewed the menu and decided on a buffet style lunch and the vendors I worked with (Cake, Balloons Statues, Slide Show, Lion Dancers, etc.) had no issues having access to the property the day of.\n\nIf you'd like to see how great it turned out and how beautiful Windsor (and my daughter) really is, we've got the video here: http://youtu.be/DCX7KZQCzcE?t=2m8s\n\nNo, they are not inexpensive but, you get what you pay for and truly, I'm sure Lake Windsor will take your wishes and concerns seriously and execute them into an unforgettable time as they did with us!", "type": "review", "business_id": "22UfD-4PEOgXTr6sev5McQ"}

It was nice, but I don't remember a whole lot about it.  I'm more about the golf.\n\nHow you like this course will likely depend on when you go.  If it's been raining recently, or is a \"wet summer\", you'll find several holes are quite soggy.  Greens, fairways, teeboxes - all areas can be affected.\n\nDuring dry periods, like today (it rained 3 days ago), it wasn't bad and the course was in relatively good shape.  I don't know if it was the sunshine or how the rough was cut (or not cut), but it was really hard to spot a ball in areas where it should be easy.  That was frustrating. \n\nThe course layout is nice with some rolling elevation change (nothing drastic) and water in play on many holes.  A few par 4's will make you think about going around or over water for your second shot - that's always fun!\n\nSo, while not my favorite course in in the area, I will golf here often.  It nice enough and if you look around you can find some good deals.  The staff are always very pleasant and helpful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "22UfD-4PEOgXTr6sev5McQ"}

I thought I'd head east and come here for lunch since I didn't find anything better. Years ago, this used to be a place called Stockade and I loved it. Now it's a Badgers/Packers bar and grill. \n\nVisible from I-90, just west of Madison, there's a cheese place (Mouse Haus I believe) and warehouses for Pepsi and Walgreen's nearby. The Rodeside Grill resembles a log cabin style fort from the outside. Years ago, this place used to be called Stockade.\n\nOnce inside, it's quite spacious with high ceilings and an all wood interior, except for the tile on the floor. The whole place looks very clean, not grungy and aged like so many bars in Wisconsin. I sat down to eat at the bar. All along the bar counter, there were blurbs and excerpts of Packers and Badgers accomplishments underneath the laminated countertop. The place even had green-colored ductwork, so I knew I was deep in Packers territory.\n\nA big screen TV aired game highlights from the Packers-Saints NFL season opener from the day before. Large men with mustaches came in for lunch, typical Wisconsin body types. I kept a low profile and my Chicago origin and calmly requested the Friday fish fry special. Having traveled up north on many occasions, this wasn't the first time I was surrounded by Packer fans. It's not hard to deal with them if you don't disclose where you're from and stick to the menu items or make a positive comment about Jordy Nelson being an awesome rising star on the team.\n\nThe fish arrived in a few minutes and it came with a side of fries that were seasoned and coated - quite tasty in fact. Coleslaw is also a can't-miss item north of Illinois and this place has it right too. I found the meal quite enjoyable. The bartender got me another iced tea and then spent a few more minutes of admiring the place. The Packers highlights gave way to NASCAR on the TV, but I was on my way, 150 miles from Chicago once again.\n\nWhile I went for the fish, Rodeside also has some good burgers, from what I saw around me at lunch that day. Worth a stop on your way to the Dells or Lodi for that matter. Just leave the Bears stuff in the car.", "type": "review", "business_id": "O_Pu4mKGOqQVlmH07Zbnhg"}
